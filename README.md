👋 Hi there! I'm @Eazy
👀 I’m interested in saltwater reef ecosystems, gaming, NFTs, and 3D graphics/dev. Oh, and talking about science, life, and the origins of humanity for hours. 🌀
🌱 I’m currently learning frontend development and optimizing my 3D portfolio for mobile & tablet (tablets deserve love too, you know!).
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on innovative gaming projects, NFT utilities, and anything that pushes creative boundaries in Web3.
📫 How to reach me: Slide into my DMs e(eazy@blockchaineazy.com) or find me in the Troverse community (Tromies unite!).
😄 Pronouns: He/Him
⚡ Fun fact: I work on an NFT gaming project where galaxies, gaming, and community collide. Also, I believe coffee is a universal development tool. ☕🚀
